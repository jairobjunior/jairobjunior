Jairo has over 10 years of experience in the Computer Science field. Coding, managing and making decisions about distributed systems involving several IPC protocols and overall architecture are his everyday thing. In his spare time, he enjoys creating wooden toys for his daughter with electronics, reading about Algorithms, Electric Engineering, CPU, Architecture, Microcontrollers and Cyber Security. Beyond programming his career has allowed him to write, teach and speak at various academic events. His favorite moments are when he sees the success of a former student, some who he ends up collaborating with.

I have designed and developed application for companies like: Disney, Legendary Pictures and Oakley.
